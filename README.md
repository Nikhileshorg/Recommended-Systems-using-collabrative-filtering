# Recommended-Systems-using-collabrative-filtering - Jupyter Notebooks

In this project, we'll develop a movie recommender system in Python that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to different movies, in order to find the similarity between the movies.

The dataset that we are going to use for this problem is the MovieLens Dataset. To download the dataset, go the home page of the dataset and download the "ml-latest-small.zip" file, which contains a subset of the actual movie dataset and contains 100000 ratings for 9000 movies by 700 users.
